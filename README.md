# Hello, I'm Lewis
I'm 16 years old and it is my dream to be a software developer. In my spare time I like to work on my own C++ projects and learn more about programming. If you are looking at my source code, please not that I am still learning and therefore it may not be as organised as other peoples and quality of code may not be the best, however I'm improving both of these things with each project I undertake. Here are some of my projects:

# Tetris in terminal:
